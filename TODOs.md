# TO DOs:

1. Extra option to show and end program when caught up to current chapter/final page.

2. Add more websites.

3. Problem:
Bing audio itself sometimes stop translating or freeze up, not exactly sure what's causing it.
Can be possibly caused by uncommon characters or maybe the word list is too long.
The problem is not due to this program but with bing translator itself. Sometimes deleting previously translated
words then restarting the audio translator allows bing to continue translating where it stopped.
Pending and brain storming solution:
3.1 Detect audio, keep track if audio stops before it can finish whole story. Trim story and restart audio?
3.2 Measure translator audio speed to determine how far the story been translated. Trim story and restart?
3.3 There is far less chance of audio freezing if the word count is shorter,
    and there is far less chance of missing important story contents due to freezing if translate part is small
    3. can maybe fix 4. by splitting the story into many parts for audio translate
	
4. More optimization and try other ways for automation, maybe use javascript.
